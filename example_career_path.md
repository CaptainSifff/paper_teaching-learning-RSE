# Example Career path for an RSE

## Intro

Meet Kay, who currently studies researchology in a Bachelor programme in researchonomy at University of Orithena (UofO).
We will follow Kay’s fictional career to illustrate how education, job-experience and a career in academic institutions could lead to becoming a successful RSE.
In Kay’s world, some of the measures this paper proposes have already been implemented.

## Bachelor

Through a program like DaLiJe or The Missing Semester, Kay learns about using computational tools to support the sophisticated statistical analysis typical for researchology.
She uses those tools to create and automate the production of her Bachelor thesis (generating plots with matplotlib, maybe even CI for automatic building) 
and takes pride in a fully open and reproducible bachelor thesis.

## Master

Kay ponders whether to continue with computational researchology, which her Bachelor supervisor is responsible for, or enrol in a generic RSE Master programme.
Researchers in computational researchology need to acquire a large part of the general RSE know-how presented
in this paper and specialise in Quantum-Accelerated Bayesian Optimisation methods.
However, Kay decides to go the more generic route of a dedicated RSE programme because she wants to continue in academia,
but does not like the idea of becoming stuck with one research topic.
She also observed that the immediate satisfaction gained by helping colleagues from her research group with tricky technical
problems makes her happier than the subdued sense of achievement from having a research paper accepted long after she had written it.

The generic RSE Master programme consists of a core of RSE topics with various electives for specialisation.
Kay chooses digital archaeology and develops a pipeline for reconstructing 3D models from ground penetrating radar data, to simplify the process for archaeologists (Reproducibility, Big Data, ML).
The project management skills that are being taught as part of the core RSE curriculum really help her to not get lost in this project.
Apart from working with the researchers in her archaeology group she has to work with members of the central RSE department to help her with the pipelines. 
She also has to liaise with the central IT department to organise storage for the large data sets.
Towards the end of the programme she visits her first RSE conference.
Kay has now completed the RSE programme and has reached Junior RSE level.

## Junior RSE

Kay finds a position in the central RSE department at her university with a competitive IT salary. 
Although the contract is temporary there is a good chance that it will lead to a permanent position.
Kay completes the Software Carpentry Instructor training and teaches basic research computing. 
She also runs a seminar in the RSE Master programme.
After two years she takes an exciting opportunity to work in another university.

## Senior RSE

The new position involves taking responsibility for the RSE related aspects of a large inter-organisational project (Verbundprojekt). 

+ Senior RSE skills ...

The job-experience as a leading RSE for a large project was the last requirement necessary to obtain the "Senior RSE Expert" certificate from the
International Association for Research Software Engineering.
This certificate is recognised by various funding agencies, such as the DFG, and enables RSEs without PhD to act as a Principal Investigator for RSE-focused grant applications
and enables her now to obtain funds for her own projects.
