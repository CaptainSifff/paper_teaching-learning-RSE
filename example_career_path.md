# Example Career path for an RSE

## Intro

Meet Kay, who currently studies researchology in a Bachelor program student in researchonomy at University of Orithena (UofO). We will follow Kay’s fictional career to illustrate how education, job-experience and a career in academic institutions could play together to produce a successful RSE. In Kay’s world, some of the measures this paper proposes have already been implemented.

## Bachelor

Through a program like DaLiJe or The Missing Semester, Kay learns about using computational tools to support the sophisticated statistical analysis typical for researchology. He  uses those tools for creation and automation when compiling his Bachelor thesis (generating plots with matplotlib, maybe even CI for automatic building) and  takes pride in a fully open and reproducible bachelor thesis.

## Master

Kay ponders whether to continue with computational researchology, which her Bachelor supervisor is responsible for, or enroll in a generic RSE Master’s program. Researchers in computational researchology need to acquire a large part of the general RSE know-how presented in this paper and specialize in Quantum-Accelerated Bayesian Optimization methods. However, Kay decides to go the more generic route of a dedicated RSE program because she wants to continue in academia, but not doesn't like the idea to become stuck with one research topic. She also observed that the immediate satisfaction gained by helping colleagues from her research group with tricky technical problems makes her happier than the subdued sense of achievement from having a research paper accepted long after you have written it. 

+ The generic RSE Master’s consists a core of RSE topics with various electives for specialication
+ Kai chooses digital archaeology
+ Develops pipeline for reconstruction of 3D models from under ground sonar data, to simplify the process for archaeologists (Reproducibility, Big Data, ML?)
+ Own project => basic project management skills (part of core RSE topics taught)
+ Works with other people (central RSE department, central IT department) => team skills?
+ Visits first RSE conference towards the end of the program
+ During the Master course she reaches Junior level according to the paper and is ready to work as such after the program

## Junior RSE

+ Permanent position in RSE department at her university with competitive IT salary
+ Learns to teach
+ Teaches the basics to other researchers
+ Teaches a seminar in the RSE Master’s program
+ Works there for two years

## Senior RSE

+ Takes a position as a RSE responsible within a new research group at another university
+ Takes responsibility for RSE related parts of research of a large inter-organizational project (Verbundprojekt) as part of this new position
+ Senior RSE skills ...

The job-experience as a leading RSE for a large project was the last requirement necessary to obtain the "Senior RSE Expert" certificate from the International Association for Research Software Engineering. This certificate is recognized by various funding agencies, such as the DFG, and enables RSEs without PhD act as a Principal Investigator for RSE-focused grant applications.
